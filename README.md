# Bioinformatics Analysis of Shared Molecular Mechanisms Between SARS-CoV-2 Infection and Alzheimer’s Disease

## Project Overview
This project aims to investigate the shared molecular mechanisms between SARS-CoV-2 infection and Alzheimer’s disease using bioinformatics-based analysis.
By integrating gene expression analysis and pathway enrichment approaches, the study identifies common differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and biological pathways that may link viral infection to neurodegenerative processes.

## Background
SARS-CoV-2 infection has been increasingly associated with neurological and cognitive complications beyond its respiratory effects.
Alzheimer’s disease is a major neurodegenerative disorder characterized by neuroinflammation, immune dysregulation, and protein misfolding.
Recent studies suggest that COVID-19 and neurodegenerative diseases may share overlapping molecular pathways, motivating this bioinformatics analysis.

## Aim and Objectives

### Aim
To identify shared molecular mechanisms between SARS-CoV-2 infection and Alzheimer’s disease.

### Objectives
- Identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection
- Identify DEGs associated with Alzheimer’s disease
- Determine shared genes between both conditions
- Perform KEGG pathway enrichment analysis on shared genes

---

## Methodology
The analysis follows established bioinformatics pipelines reported in previous large-scale studies.

### Workflow
1. Collection of gene expression datasets from public databases (GEO)
2. Differential gene expression analysis
3. Identification of shared differentially expressed genes
4. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis
5. Biological interpretation of shared pathways

All analyses and visualizations were implemented using **Python in Google Colab**.

## Results
- Identification of representative shared genes between SARS-CoV-2 infection and Alzheimer’s disease
- Enrichment of key KEGG pathways, including:
  - Alzheimer’s disease pathway (hsa05022)
  - SARS-CoV-2 infection pathway (hsa05171)

These results suggest a potential molecular overlap between viral infection and neurodegenerative mechanisms.

- A programmatically generated bioinformatics workflow flowchart
- KEGG pathway enrichment bar plots
- Visualization of representative shared genes

All figures were generated using Python and included in the project report and presentation.
